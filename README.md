Card Fraud Detection Model
This repository contains a card fraud detection model designed to detect fraudulent transactions in card images. The model utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of both genuine and fraudulent card images, which served as the foundation for training and evaluating the model.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, and it includes a diverse set of card images, including genuine and fraudulent examples. The dataset was carefully curated to represent various real-world scenarios and challenges associated with card fraud detection.

Model Architecture
The card fraud detection model is built using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed to automatically extract relevant features from the card images. The architecture also incorporates fully connected layers to learn complex patterns and make accurate fraud predictions.

Training Process
To train the model, the dataset was split into training and validation sets. The model's parameters were then optimized using an appropriate optimization algorithm, and its performance was fine-tuned iteratively. The training process was carried out on a GPU to accelerate computation, enabling faster convergence and improved efficiency.

Model Evaluation
The trained model's performance was evaluated using a separate test dataset, ensuring that it can generalize well to unseen card images. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score were computed to assess the model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
